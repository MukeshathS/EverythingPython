Challenge 5.1 - 
-------------
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:  

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.  
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.  
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:  

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.  
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.  

Examples -  

* grade = 84 round to 85 (85 - 84 is less than 3)
* grade = 29 do not round (result is less than 40)
* grade = 57 do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.

Function Description

* int grades[n]: the grades before rounding
Returns

* int[n]: the grades after rounding as appropriate
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , the number of students.
